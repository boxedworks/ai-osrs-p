# Prompt rules
All prompts submitted will be used. Submitted prompts are added to a pool and are chosen at random. After being chosen, it has a chance to either be: 
- (33%) Kept in the pool (can be randomly selected again)
- (66%) Removed from the pool (archived)

# Prompt usage
Type "!prompt " followed by your description to create a prompt. Include characters and locations into a scene by including their names. 

## Characters
Including only one character will add a random selection of other characters into the scene. Including more than one character will only have those selected characters in the scene.
- Sam
- Trish
- Gary
- Bob
- Larry
### Hidden Characters
"Hidden" characters will only appear if included in a prompt.
- Man

## Actions
Apply actions to characters by using the syntax: Character(Action). Example: Bob(dancing). Actions with an asterisk can be done anywhere. Other actions (specific actions) can only be done in proper areas. For instance, you cannot runecraft if there is no runecrafting altar, cannot fish with no fishing spot, cannot sit without a chair, etc. If no actions are described, or the action is invalid, random actions are applied. Only one action per character.

**NOTE:** Most specific actions can only be done in a few areas, some only having one. Detailing which locations specific actions can be done is a WIP.

## Locations
Location names with a "/" mean you can use either name. Only one location can be used per prompt. If more than one is included, a random one is selected out of the locations provided. If more than one location shares the same name, using that name will pick randomly between them.
