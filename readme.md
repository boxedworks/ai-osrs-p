# QUICK START
**Just type into chat:** !Put anything you want here.
> Example: !What is the best skill in RuneScape?

# Prompt rules
All prompts submitted will eventually be used to generate a scene. Submitted prompts are added to a pool and are chosen at random. After being chosen, it has a chance to either be: 
- (33%) Kept in the pool (can be randomly selected again)
- (66%) Removed from the pool (archived)

Prompts can have a max length of 250 characters. If a prompt is longer than the max length, it will be trimmed.
# Prompt usage
Type "!" followed by your description to create a prompt. Read below to include specific characters, their actions, and location.
> Example: !Everyone says: "wc lvl?"

## Characters
Include one or multiple characters' names in a prompt to add them to the generated scene.
> Example: !Larry wants to see Gary's stats.

Including only one character will add a random selection of other characters into the scene. Including more than one character will only have those selected characters in the scene.
- Sam
- Trish
- Gary
- Bob
- Larry
- Gobb <sub>*This character is a WIP.</sub>
- Narrator <sub>*This character is a WIP.</sub>
### Hidden Characters
"Hidden" characters will only appear if included in a prompt.
- Man

## Locations
Include a location's name in a prompt to force the location of a generated scene.

> Example: !Bob does Law runs at Entrana.

Location names with a "/" mean you can use either name. Only one location can be used per prompt. If more than one is included, a random one is selected out of the locations provided.

## Actions
Apply actions to characters by using the syntax: Character(Action). 

> Example: !Bob(dancing) just got a fat drop and Larry is jealous.

Actions with an asterisk can be done anywhere. Other actions (specific actions) can only be done in specific locations. For instance, you cannot runecraft if there is no runecrafting altar, cannot fish with no fishing spot, cannot sit without a chair, etc. If no actions are described, or the action is invalid, random actions are applied. Only one action per character.

**NOTE:** Most specific actions can only be done in a few areas, some only having one. Detailing which locations-specific actions can be done is a WIP.
