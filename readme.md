# Prompt rules
All prompts submitted will be used. Submitted prompts are added to a pool and are chosen at random. After being chosen, it has a 50% chance to either be: 
- Kept in the pool (can be randomly selected again)
- Removed from the pool (archived)

# Prompt usage:
Type "!prompt " followed by your description to create a prompt. Include characters and locations into a scene by including their names. 

Including only one character will add a random selection of other characters into the scene. Including more than one character will only have those selected characters in the scene.

Location names with a "/" mean you can use either name. Only one location can be used per prompt.
